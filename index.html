    This beautiful web page was created in 2020. Now in 2021 I have a new link to share! A <a
        href="macroquad_wasm/macroquad_snake.html">Snake game</a> made in rust with macroquad and web
    assembly. The Controls are WASD. What did I learn while constructing this?
    <ul>
        <li>the rand crate does not work with Web assembly. macroquad::rand is an alternative for pseudo random number
            generation.</li>
        <li>the std::time module does not work with web assembly... But how do I get UNIX Timestamps in u128 format
            then?</li>
        <li>if you build with the --release flag for the wasm target: The resulting .wasm file is significantly smaller
            (2 MB vs 11 MB)</li>

    </ul>
    Now a second demo is added: A <a href="macroquad_wasm/macroquad_snow_sim.html">Snow Simulation</a>!
    <ul>
        <li>A Vec<(usize, usize)> was used as the data structure to store the falling/moving snowfalkes. Is this the
                optimal choice for this? Frequent removal of random elements in the vector occur in this simulation.
        </li>
        <li>when your redrawing the screen is conditioned with an if statement (maybe to set a hard limit on the fps,
            which is unimplemented in the macroquad lib for now) the screen starts to flicker!</li>
        <li>The basic-http-server is a great tool to test your websites...</li>
        <li>Format html with Ctrl+Shift+I in VsCode</li>
        <li>Thought: Evaluate purpose fullfilling role of random number generator with such a snow simulation. (equal
            distirubtion of random numbers)</li>
    </ul>
    Now a <a href="macroquad_wasm/macroquad_tictactoe.html">TicTacToe</a> Game exists too! Sadly
    this did not work for a long time after a breaking change occured. I did not make any changes to the wasm files,
    meaning the origin had to be a breaking
    change a)in the web-browser, b) in the javascript. <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/issues/221">I later
        found out</a> the javascript is always updated to the newest version of macroquad. Thats why you should download
    the javascript and host it yourself to keep these working in stable condition or use a specific version from
    <a=href="https://not-fl3.github.io/miniquad-samples/mq_js_bundle_0.3.1.js">miniquad-samples like this</a>. I updated
    the rust macroquad code to 0.3 (many changes occured since 0.2.*) and now hosting the <a
        href="macroquad_wasm/macroquad_gl.js">up to date javascript myself </a> so that
    breaking changes and more work can be avoided in the future.

    Exploring 2D level generation with <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr"> Evcxr </a> Jupyter notebooks. The used
    algorithms only use integers in their calculations (u32, u64, i64), making them <b>deterministic</b>, as opposed to
    <b>undeterministic</b> if <b>floats</b> (f64, f32) where used. <b>Deterministic behavior</b> would be important in a
    multiplayer scenario, where the client and server can repeat the same calculations and simulations to verify each
    others results more quickly and without sending too much data between each other (the hashes of the results would be
    enough). The only thing to worry about when using integers are overflowing airthmetic operations(bitschifting <<,
        addition +, multiplication *, substraction (with unsigned integers worrysome) -)wich will result in panics.
        Introducing "smooth looking" behavior with whole number/integer divisions only is another problem. <ul>
        <li><a href="rust_jupyter_notebooks/truchet_patterns.html">Truchet patterns</a></td> are generated by repeating
            a simple base tile (with a simple pattern, 2 lines two circles, ...) that are flipped randomly (horizontal
            flips). This results in interesting patterns.</li>
        <li><a href="rust_jupyter_notebooks/line_drawing.html">Line Drawing</a></td>. Given two 2D vectors (x1, y1) and
            (x2, y2) you want to find out wheter thesese are linearly dependent or not. It turns out there is a quite
            simple condition for doing that: <b>0 == x1*y1-x2*y1</b> (is this related to the cross product?). Only
            additions and multiplications are used to verify this condition, meaning all numbers x1, y1, x2 and y2 can
            be integers and not just floats. This idea was exploited to draw lines only using integers and generate
            patterns that look like vornoi diagrams. The same idea can be used to rasterize lines or <a href="rust_jupyter_notebooks/triangel_rasterization.html">draw triangles</a>.
            <a href=https://gist.github.com/gubbu/f9f668a561f7cb483dbb8478a0cc4add> bresenham algorithm</a>is longer and
            more complicated imo(but it needs less multiplications, which where expensive in the past).
        </li>
        <li> <a href="rust_jupyter_notebooks/plotting_test.html">Exploring our integer "hash" function</a></td>. To get
            a desired "pseudo random seed based" function and not rely on the (bloated and complicated to use imo) rand
            crate, a modified version of Jankins hash function was used. To get an overview over its "random number
            generation", based on linearly increasing seed i, some sample plots where created. The sample plots show
            some gaps, meaning its results are not that evenly distributed, which is not great, but ok for our
            application. All functions in the notebooks above where written in a way that make the seed based random
            number generation function
